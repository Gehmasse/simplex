# Simplex Algorithm for Linear Optimisation

-   Install PHP and composer
-   Run `composer install`

-   Input the first simplex tableau
-   Run the algorithm
-   It outputs all intermediate steps and the optimal solution
-   By now, it cannot handle special cases (degeneracy, multiple optimal solutions, unbounded solution)

See `index.php` or run `php index.php` for an example.
